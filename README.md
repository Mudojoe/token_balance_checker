## Purpose

* Python script to fetch cryptocurrency wallet balances using the Etherscan API.

## Setup

* **Dependencies:** 
    * Etherscan API route
    * requests for networking
* **API Key:**
    *  We obtained the Etherscan API key, but have not included directly in the source code for security reasons.

## Usage

* **Test Addresses:**
    * We used  wallet addresses and token addresses that we found on Etherscan, 
    * These are read-only and appropriate for testing.

    * used are included in the Notes section below.
